    I have been evaluating my personal design process as I continue the quest of what I want to be when I grow up.
    Turns out, I donâ€™t give myself enough credit.
    Shock. Or not, for those who know me.
    So, in an effort to put myself out there, this site holds all the work that I have been doing, as well as, what my current
    inspirations are.  Take a look around, and reach out if you'd like, I'd love to hear what inspires you as well!
