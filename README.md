#Project: @Peace Designs Website

My final project is actually going to be a website for a side business for a friend (assuming it turns out well!), the ultimate goal would be as a design consultancy site, but with the ability to sell her artwork, in addition to being partly a blog for her current design inspirations.

The models I will be using are:

- Art - this will display her completed artwork
- Inspiration - this will be more like blog posts that she can write and upload her current inspirations
- Designs - this section will focus on her interior design/event work
- Fashions - Similar to the Art and Design models this will hold her fashion sketches
- Users - authenticate to connect on potential projects, only the admin will have access to the db to add new files or edit posts

The Art, Fashion, and Design models are the focus of the site, with the goal to create her business as being able to consult on interior designs or be commissioned for art pieces, or sell what she has now. And the inspiration is to be more of a secondary blog for her to share things that inspire her work.

For the user authentication - this is only for the project requirements right now, there is nothing a user gets for signing up currently. However, for the edit, create, update parts of the site, those will be limited to admin authentication so that people can't be editing the content of the site without permission

Please use the login below for access to the edit, add, update pages.
